# Farm3x3
Farm 3x3 is a data pack that harvests crops in a 3x3 square if you hold a hoe.

## Mod compatibility
- [Farmer's Delight](https://github.com/RaixuStuff/Farm3x3-Farmers-Delight-Compatibility/tree/main)
- If you want any other mods to be supported, create an issue on GitHub or join my discord server and let me know!
- Feel free to make your own compatibility mods without asking for my permission.
- Any hoe from any mod _should_ work correctly in versions 2.1.0 and above, compatibility mods only provide support for modded crops.

## Notes
- The data pack/mod will not work in creative mode.
- If you want to also replant your crops as you harvest them, hold the hoe in your offhand. (in Minecraft 1.21+, Farm 3x3 2.2.0+)
